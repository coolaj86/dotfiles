### Archive ###

### Mostly from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_archive_formats

## Archiving only
# The traditional archive format on Unix-like systems, now used mainly for the
# creation of static libraries.
# *.a
# *.ar

# RPM files consist of metadata concatenated with (usually) a cpio archive.
# Newer RPM systems also support other archives, as cpio is becoming obsolete.
# cpio is also used with initramfs.
# *.cpio

# A self-extracting archive that uses the Bourne shell (sh).
# *.shar

# A system for storing multiple files. LBR archives typically contained files
# processed by SQ, or the archive itself was compressed with SQ. LBR archives
# that were compressed with SQ ended with the extension .LQR
# *.LBR

# An archive format originally used mainly for archiving and distribution of
# the exact, nearly-exact, or custom-modified contents of an optical storage
# medium such as a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM. However, it can be used to archive the
# contents of other storage media, selected partitions, folders, and/or files.
# The resulting archive is typically optimized for convenient rendering to
# (re-)writable CD or DVD media.
# *.iso

# A library format used primarily on the Commodore 64 and 128 lines of
# computers. This bears no resemblance to the DOS LBR format. While library
# files were quick to implement (a number of programs exist to work with them)
# they are crippled in that they cannot grow with use: once a file has been
# created it cannot be amended (files added, changed or deleted) without
# recreating the entire file.
# *.lbr

# An archive format used by Mozilla for storing binary diffs. Used in
# conjunction with bzip2.
# *.mar

# A common archive format used on Unix-like systems. Generally used in
# conjunction with compressors such as gzip, bzip2, compress or xz to create
# .tar.gz, .tar.bz2, .tar.Z or tar.xz files.
# *.tar

# Package managers
# Red Hat Package Manager
*.rpm
# Debian package
*.deb
# MicroSoft Installer
*.msi
*.msm
*.msp
# Mozilla package installer
*.xpi
# Ruby Package
*.gem


### Archives ###
# It's better to unpack these files and commit the raw source because
# git has its own built in compression methods.
# *.7z
# *.jar
# *.rar
# *.zip
# *.gz
# *.bzip
# *.bz2
# *.xz
# *.lzma
# *.cab

#package management formats
